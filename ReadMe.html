<ul>
<li><p>Requirements: Linux; a C++17 compiler.</p></li>
<li><p>To compiles the tests, using GNU Make, run:</p></li>
</ul>

<p>make tests</p>

<ul>
<li>To use clang++ just pass it with</li>
</ul>

<p>make CXX=clang++ tests</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Linux is necessary because entropy from /dev/random/ is used to initialize the random number generator. If not available, any seed provided to the mt19937_64 engine will do.</p></li>
<li><p>There are some (many!) simplifications: prices, last dividends, par values are <em>unsigned</em> because they are assumed to be provided in pennies and they are only initialised, never calculated (so no need to use a <em>double</em>). There are a couple of overloads, and some exceptions are raised when functions are fed with bad input (e.g. zero prices or zero rates when calculating the P/E ratio).</p></li>
